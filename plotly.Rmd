# Examples of Plotly

We are going to look at NYC Restaurant Inspection data.

```{r}

library(tidyverse)
library(p8105.datasets)
library(plotly)
library(lubridate)
```
# Load the data

Only restaurants received score greater than 10 are kept in this example.

```{r}
data("rest_inspec")

restaurant_df = 
  rest_inspec %>%
  filter(
    cuisine_description == "American",
    grade == c("A", "B", "C"),
    score %in% 10:100
  ) %>%
  mutate(inspection_date = as_date(inspection_date)) %>% 
  select(inspection_date,cuisine_description,grade,boro,score,dba)

restaurant_df
```
# Scatterplot

```{r}

restaurant_df %>%
  mutate(text_label = str_c("Grade: ", grade, "\nResturants: ", dba)) %>%
  plot_ly(
    x = ~inspection_date, y = ~score, color = ~boro, text = ~text_label,
    alpha = .5, type = "scatter", mode = "markers") %>% 
  layout(
    xaxis = list(title = "Inspection Date"),
    yaxis = list(title = "Score"),
    title = "Inspection Date vs. Score"
  )

```

# Boxplot

```{r}
restaurant_df %>%
  mutate(boro = fct_reorder(boro, score)) %>%
  plot_ly(
    y = ~score, x = ~boro, color = ~boro, 
    type = "box", colors = "viridis") %>%
  layout(
    xaxis = list(title = "Restaurant Location"),
    yaxis = list(title = "Score"),
    title = "Location vs. Score"
    )
```



# Bar plot

```{r}
restaurant_df %>%
  count(boro) %>%
  mutate(boro = fct_reorder(boro, n)) %>%
  plot_ly(
    x = ~boro, y = ~n, color = ~boro, 
    type = "bar", colors = "viridis") %>%
   layout(
    xaxis = list(title = "Restaurant Location"),
    yaxis = list(title = "Count"),
    title = "Location vs. Count"
  )
```
